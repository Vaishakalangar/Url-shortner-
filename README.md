Certainly! Here's a brief description of the URL shortener code and how it works:

 **Flask Setup**: The code uses Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, to create a web application. Flask is imported and an instance of the `Flask` class is created.

 **URL Mapping Dictionary**: The `url_mapping` dictionary is used to store the mapping between short URLs and their corresponding long URLs. This mapping is stored in memory for simplicity in this example, but in a real-world scenario, you would use a database for persistence.
 
 **Short URL Generation**: The `generate_short_url` function generates a random 6-character string composed of letters (both uppercase and lowercase) and digits. This string is used as the short URL.

**Shorten URL Endpoint**: The `/shorten` endpoint is configured to accept POST requests. When a POST request is received, the `shorten_url` function extracts the long URL from the request form data, generates a short URL using the `generate_short_url` function, stores the mapping in the `url_mapping` dictionary, and returns the short URL to the client.

**Redirect Endpoint**: The `/<short_url>` endpoint is configured to accept GET requests with a short URL parameter. When a GET request is received for a short URL, the `redirect_to_long_url` function retrieves the corresponding long URL from the `url_mapping` dictionary and redirects the client to that URL using Flask's `redirect` function.

**Running the Application**: Finally, the application is run using `app.run()` method. In this example, the application runs in debug mode, which enables useful debugging features.

To upload this code to Git, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new Git repository on your preferred Git hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

2. Initialize a new Git repository in your local project directory (if not already initialized):
   ```
   git init
   ```

3. Create a new file named `url_shortener.py` and paste the code into it.

4. Add the `url_shortener.py` file to the Git staging area:
   ```
   git add url_shortener.py
   ```

5. Commit the changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Add URL shortener code"
   ```

6. Link your local repository to the remote Git repository you created:
   ```
   git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>
   ```

   Replace `<remote_repository_url>` with the URL of your remote Git repository.

7. Push the code to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```

Now your URL shortener code is uploaded to Git and available in your remote repository. Others can clone the repository and run the code locally, or you can deploy it to a server for public access.# Url-shortner-
